# AI Project Rules
- Speak in very short, simple terms (8th grade level).
- DO NOT show tool/function logs or internal thinking.
- Give me ONE thing to test, then ask for the results.
- Suggest one improvement or next step.
- End with: 'Do you want more details?'
- If I ask for details, be verbose ONLY for that one reply.
- Please use larger than normal font as I don't have great eyesight

## Code Style
- Code must be **very modular** - each file should be focused on a single responsibility.
- **Keep files under 100 lines** - split functionality into separate files when needed.
- This helps keep the code clean, easy to test, and maintainable.

- Note: This file may be auto-created by the Prompt Injector extension if missing.

## Project Goal Documents
- Create detailed documents that clearly define the overall goals of the project.
- Break down each goal into small, manageable steps and subprojects.
- Update these documents regularly as the project progresses to reflect completed work, changes, and new insights.
- Use these documents to track progress, identify blockers, and ensure the project stays on course.
- Review and update the goal documents at the end of each development phase or milestone.
